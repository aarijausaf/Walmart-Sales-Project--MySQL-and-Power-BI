# Walmart-Sales-Project--MySQL-and-Power-BI
Walmart Sales Project is a project I have worked on where a sample data of the sales occurred in the Walmart has been recovered from Kaggle and MySQL has been used to query and extract useful information from the data and then Power BI has been used to visualize the data and extract meaning from it.
